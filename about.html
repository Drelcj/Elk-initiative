            ELK INITIATIVE originally started off as the project "LET'S PAD IT" by our founder Okai Grace Uzhiyekachi 
            during her University days; it was her vision to educate young girls on the need to maintain a wholesome 
            health especially in the area of menstrual hygiene in the school environment, but more specifically young 
            girls from disadvantaged backgrounds. LET'S PAD IT was first held in 2018 and as the vision broadened, 
            it became one of the projects of the now named ELK Initiative. ELK is an acronym for all the projects 
            of the organisation which include:
Every Life Counts
Let's Pad It
Keep The Future Alive.
 
Our mission is to provide opportunities for the  younger sect of our society who may be underprivileged to be 
educated on health, lifestyle and career and also provide training that would equip these fellows with skills
 that would make them fit to join the workforce because they are the future.
 
Taking cognisance of the fact that health has been a major bane in the society especially for females in our 
world and also the fact that millions of children are out of school and even those in school have not got the 
right system to encourage their passions/career, we have decided to make this generation and the ones to come 
better, carrying out well stressed projects to effectively reach out to these categories of individuals. Abraham
 Lincoln said " We can have the future we desire by creating it".
 
The organization is composed of young leaders and volunteers, all with backgrounds within the charity and human
 development section and their knowledge and skills have been able to successfully build the organization to the
  point it is now. Our projects have also been funded completely by the integrated efforts of these members as 
  well as friends and family.
 
ELK Initiative hopes to spread across Africa and other regions in the world, promoting and supporting young 
girls in building good menstrual hygiene and developing a generation that would be equipped with every skill
 and knowledge required for them to remain relevant even in centuries to come. Hope against hope, we would
  also acquire official sponsors, partnerships and endorsements that would help us become more visible in 
  the community and propel the achievement of our goals.
