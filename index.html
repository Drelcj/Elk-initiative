                    <p>ELK Initiative is a body of young people with an aim of raising every class in the society to an ultimate level of nobility in health,lifestyle and career. Taking cognisance of the fact that health has been a major bane in the society especially for women and children in this part of the world, and also the fact that millions of children are out of school, and even those in school haven't got the right system to encourage their passions/career, we have decided to strive tomake this generation and the one to come a better one, with strategies on how to effectively reach out to these categories of individuals to curb this situation. 

                        Elk is also an animal that depicts stamina, integrity, vision of fulfillment. It's energy radiates pride in the idea of the pursuit and ultimate fulfillment of being the highest and best self possible. So as an organization, we are strongly focused on depicting all this animal represents and more in every body or group we come in contact with. This we do through the projects
